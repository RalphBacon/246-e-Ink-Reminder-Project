### An e-Ink / e-Paper project that is actually useful!  
So I finally found a project that suited the e-ink display I had from Adafruit very well.  

The display remains "on screen" even without any power being applied so the unit wakes up once a day, updates the display and goes back to sleep.  

During sleep, the low power ThingPulse ePulse ESP32 module consumes about 27μA so the batteries should last for over a year. We shall see!  

The tricolour screen (that I'm using here) takes a whopping 15 seconds to refresh, but the monochrome displays take just 2 seconds, says Adafruit.
